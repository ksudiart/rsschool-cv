## Self-presentation
At school I studied programming language "Basic" and wrote programs in it. But after serving in the army, I did not become a programmer. I worked in the it field in the direction of the implementation of software products.

At the same time I was interested in website development. I began to study different technologies for website development. But it is necessary to combine current work and the study of web technologies. And it slows down my further development as a web programmer.

Training in RS-School and further practice (work) in the direction of web-development will help me to become a Front-end developer.
